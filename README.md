# Seminare

This repository contains the supporting code for my A-levels thesis, a registration management system for students signing up to events.

It implements these features:

-   Event listing, optionally restricted by class
-   An event view with options, optionally restricted to one per student
-   User settings for changing their class
-   Students can only sign up to events during their sign up periods
-   SSO via Google
